6) For colorizing an image run this in the terminal: 
   ` python colorize.py [model path] [image path][modelno] `
        Here, the model Number is
        0 for ReLU model
        1 for Tanh colorizer model
        2 for Tanh Transfer Learning model
        
7)The result will be saved as “Result.jpg”
